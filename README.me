It is about a cheque deposit use case of a banking system. This use case involves two classes, Client and Cheque, which are linked by an association class Deposit. Each class or association class is described by a set of attributes and defines some operations to create new instances or delete the existing ones. We make the assumption that the first attribute of each class denotes its key. As specified by the multiplicities, each cheque may be deposited by one client at most (multiplicity 0..1), whereas each client may deposit zero to several cheques (multiplicity 0..âˆ—). In addition, the bank manages a set of users that can join/leave the bank at any moment.
